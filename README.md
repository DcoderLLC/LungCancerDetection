# Lung Cancer Prediction Project
================================

### Welcome to ReadMe!

[Visit the live demo]() to try out the application!

## Description
---------------

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various patient characteristics and medical imaging features. The project uses a combination of Python and React to create a web-based application that can be used by medical professionals to input patient data and receive a predicted risk score.

## Getting Started
-------------------

### Installation

To run the project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

* Node.js (for the React frontend)
* Python (for the machine learning model)
* Vite (for building and serving the React app)
* React (for building the user interface)
* Material-UI (for styling the user interface)
* Tailwind CSS (for customizing the UI styles)
* React Icons (for icons and graphics)
* Python packages:
	+ Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
	+ NumPy (for numerical computations)
	+ TensorFlow (for building and training the machine learning model)
	+ Keras (for building and training the machine learning model)
	+ Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

### Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `pip install`.
3. Run the React app using `vite` or `npm run dev`.
4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Features
------------

* User-friendly interface for inputting patient data
* Machine learning model trained on a dataset of lung cancer patients
* Predicted risk score based on inputted patient data
* Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Responsive design using Material-UI and Tailwind CSS

## Technical Details
--------------------

### Frontend
